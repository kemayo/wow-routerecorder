# RouteRecorder

WoW developer tool for recording a route that your character follows. Every second, a new point in the route will be recorded if you've moved at least 10 yards from the last point. Once you're done, a box will pop up so you can copy the coordinates to somewhere else.

Click the icon in the addon compartment to start recording. Click again to stop. Right-click for some options about the route.

Routes from the current session will appear on your world map.

I use this to work on my HandyNotes plugins, because eyeballing coordinates on the world map is a pain.
